# Mossentials - Moritz's essential packages
This is a LaTeX package providing the packages and options that I use.
This was mainly done to make it easier for me to change small options globally (e.g. locale).

## Options
* Fonts (default is kpfonts)
    * lmodern
    * gfsdidot
    * fourier
    * garamond
* colorlinks (sets hyperref colorlinks option)
* german (sets babel and siunitx locale to german, default is english)
* onehalfspacing (loads setspace with option onehalfspacing)
* doublespacing (should be obvious)
